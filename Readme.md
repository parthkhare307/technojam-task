## Task 9- TODO LIST 
To counter this I firstly saw a tutorial on Udemy in which i got some basic knowledge on HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT languages . 
later on i started to make some basic web pages like  my name and some images on it. 
after i got handy with the code i finally started comming on the main task of Technojam .
Firstly I wrote the code for the Body of the Web app(HTML) . Then started working on the backend side of the Web app, JavaScript. After i got finised
with this I started working on the frontend of the app, i.e., HTML and CSS. I made a function in which The user has to enter the task which he/she wants to
do. Finally, the user can interact with the webapp and add and modify his tasks and also delete them accordingly.

## Task 10: WORD COUNT
I made a web application in which the user can input some paragraph, and get the number of words present in the passage realtime.
I added a clear button too, so that the user can delete the paragraph and get started with a new paragraph accoding to his need.

## Task-11: BIRTHDAY CARD
I lookded up on the website "udacity" to find some basic courses of android studio as I was pretty new to the domain, In the card,
I used Imageviwe to add a background to the birthday card, and added TextView for some basic texts (eg, Happy Birthday..., Made by...).
Finally I built the app using gradle and stored it in a folder. I also built the .apk file so that anyone can install and see the message,
"Happy Birthday To You!".
